ALL ABOUT GIT REMOTE
  **git remote 
  if this is connected - it should show us all the remote available 

  **git remote add <alias> <url> 
  i.e git remote add origin https://github.com/iKnowJavaScript/my_git_note.git

   you can set up more than one remote for your project
    and even give them different name
    **git remote -v 
      gives us a little more information
    **git remote rm <alias > 
      to remove a remote

    **push branch onlime
      **git push -u origin master

      **git branch -r
        shows the remote branch
      ** git branch -a
        List both remote and local


    Further pushing origin to master(remote)
    **git push origin master

    CLONE
      To grab a complete copy of another user's repository, use git clonelike this:
     ** git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
        # Clones a repository to your computer
    
    FETCH
      Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository 
     grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes 
      into your own branches.
       $ git fetch remotename
       # Fetches updates made to a remote repository

    MERGE
      Merging combines your local changes with changes made by others.
      Typically, you'd merge a remote-tracking branch (i.e., a branch fetched from a 
      remote repository) with your local branch:
        $ git merge remotename/branchname
        # Merges updates made online with your local work

    PULL
      git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git mergein 
      the same command:
        $ git pull remotename branchname
        #  Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work

HOW FETCH, MERGE and PULL WORKS
        You can fetch from remote to check if your commit log is in sync with master 
      **git fetch origin
        Then check the log
      **git log --origin/master   #if the branch is master
        Then compare your git log with the branch your in
      You can the MERGE
      Its advisable to fetch often to be in sync with remote as often as possible
      
      **git pull
