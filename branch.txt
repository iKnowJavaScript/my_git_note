###This is Mainly about Branches in Git

**git diff <branch1>..<branch2>
    git diff --color-words <branch1>..<branch2>   //Color words ver
    Helps knows the different between two branches
     
**git diff <branch1>..<branch2> //for easier understanding

** cat .git/HEAD
    To know where the head point at in a branch

 ** git show HEAD 
    Bring up the last commit and what they added to the repo 

** git log  --oneline
    Handy one liner git commit deatils

** git log --oneline --decorate --all
    Shed more light on commit related to branch

** git branch --merged
    will show us all the branches that are currently merge to this branch 

**git branch 
    show us all the branches we have in our curent repo
    
 **git branch new-feature
    To create a new branch

**git checkout new_feature
    To switch to the new created file


***MERGING BRANCHES*** 
    Checkout to the branch that will receive the changes 
    The branch we are merging into (In this case Master)
    **git checkout master

 
 RENAMING BRANCHES
    ** git branch -m new_feature new_feature_rename
        NOTE: -m or --move is MOVE and its consider rename
 
 DELETE BRANCH
    switch to the master or parent branch and create locate the branch you want to DELETE
    dont delete the branch you are currently working on at the moment

    **git branch -d <bran ch-to-delete>
        if you have some unmerge changes to master You will have to use -D to confirm delete
 

 *** MERGING BRANCHES ***
    Navigate to the branch your want to merge into and perform this command
        **git merge <branch-name>
    If the MERGER branch HEAD is included in the MERGEE branch then we have a FAST-FORWARD merge
        **git merge --no-ff branch 
                (force the merge to create a commit)
        **git merge --ff-only branch
                (proceed with the merge only if its fast forward merge) 

*** Git Stashing ***
    Saving  uncommited changes for to be use later
        ** git stash save "stash message here" 

    work on some couple things and pop the stash changes back 
        **git stash list 
            to see changes that are in my stash
            This stash changes can be used in another branch 
        **git stash show stash{0}
            Tell more about the stash item 
        **git stash show -p stash@{0}   //show the changes too 

    Applying stash changes
        **git stash pop stash@{0}
            remove the item from stash
        **git stash apply
            leave a copy in the stash 
    Delete item in the stash without applying them
         **git stash drop stash@{0} 
         **git stash clear 
            clear the whole stash
