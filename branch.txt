###This is Mainly about Branches in Git

**git diff <branch1>..<branch2>
    git diff --color-words <branch1>..<branch2>   //Color words ver
    Helps knows the different between two branches
     
**git diff <branch1>..<branch2> //for easier understanding

** cat .git/HEAD
    To know where the head point at in a branch

 ** git show HEAD 
    Bring up the last commit and what they added to the repo 

** git log  --oneline
    Handy one liner git commit deatils

** git log --oneline --decorate --all
    Shed more light on commit related to branch

** git branch --merged
    will show us all the branches that are currently merge to this branch 

**git branch 
    show us all the branches we have in our curent repo
    
 **git branch new-feature
    To create a new branch

**git checkout new_feature
    To switch to the new created file


***MERGING BRANCHES*** 
    Checkout to the branch that will receive the changes 
    The branch we are merging into (In this case Master)
    **git checkout master

 
 RENAMING BRANCHES
    ** git branch -m new_feature new_feature_rename
        NOTE: -m or --move is MOVE and its consider rename
 
 DELETE BRANCH
    switch to the master or parent branch and create locate the branch you want to DELETE
    dont delete the branch you are currently working on at the moment

    **git branch -d <branch-to-delete>
        if you have some unmerge changes to master You will have to use -D to confirm delete
 

 *** MERGING BRANCHES ***
    Navigate to the branch your want to merge into and perform this command
        **git merge <branch-name>
    If the MERGER branch HEAD is included in the MERGEE branch then we have a FAST-FORWARD merge
        **git merge --no-ff branch 
                (force the merge to create a commit)
        **git merge --ff-only branch
                (proceed with the merge only if its fast forward merge)
