This file we document intermideate knowledge in git

## When changes are made in multiple files across folder use this command to add and commit
    **git commit -am "files are added automatically and commited to repo"

    **git add somFolder/*       //adds everything in the directory

## if you accidentally deleted some text in a 
    file but yet to add and commit the the file 
    **use git diff to see the deleted file and revert it with

    ** git checkout -- filename

## if there are some changes that has not been staged and you would like to delete them
    **git clean -file   
        will remove the form the repo

## If you git add a file into staging area. you can unstage it using   
    **git reset HEAD <filename>

## This is the file i mean to uncommit in the future
    **git reset --hard HEAD~1
        return the head to the previous commit and delete the least commit.

    **git revert <SHA-1 or commit ID> (without quote)
        reset the repo to the state before this commit id was made

    **git commit --amend -m "new message name"
        changes the recent commit message
        This always change the last commit message (The commit the HEAD is pointing to)
        This always changes the SHA-1 (commit ID)

    #Using reset to undo many commit
        This is a bit dangerous (Use with exreme caution) 
        **git reset --soft <SHA of commit id>           //change the pointer to SHA but file are still staged
        **git reset --mixed <SHA of commit id>            //file are unstaged
        **git reset --hard <SHA of commit id>          //files are completely deleted now




IGNORING FILES
    ** .gitignore
        *.php 
            ignore all files with .php extension 
        *!index.php 
            But dont ignore index.php
        *db/
            Ignores all files in db folder
         

    **git rm --cached<filename>
        remove the file from tracking index and can now be ignored by git 

### git log --oneline
    gives us the log in one line each, comprises of commit comment and SHA 

    ***it log --oneline -5
        will show us just 5 latest commit 

### Compare commit (This help us know what has changed in the directory)
    i.e  whats changed since our first commmit on monday to the last one on fiday
     **git diff <SHA>             //check the diff between the commit and now
     **git diff <SHA>  <filename>  
     **it diff <SHA>..<SHA>       //to compare between two commit
